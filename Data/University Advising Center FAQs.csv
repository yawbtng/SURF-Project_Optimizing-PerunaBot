question, answer
What's the difference between all-college GPA and SMU GPA?,"Your all-college GPA is the GPA used from all your grades at any college or university you’ve attended, including SMU. 
Your SMU GPA is your GPA based only on your SMU grades. Some schools/majors use your all-college GPA or grades in courses you’ve
 taken at another institution to determine if they will admit you to their major."
What is a failing grade?,"An ""F"" is a failing grade. With a ""D-"" and above you will earn course credit, 
but may not meet the requirements for your major or be able to progress in a sequence of classes. 
If you make a ""C"" or lower in a class, double check your major requirements in the SMU Catalog or ask your academic advisor."
"Can I get ""Freshman Forgiveness""? What is a Grade Replacement Repeat?","""Freshman Forgiveness"" doesn’t exist. However, SMU does have the Grade Replacement Repeat policy that students may take advantage of, 
regardless of their year. For classes taken Fall 2017 and later, if you made a D+ or lower in a course, 
you may repeat the course here at SMU and the second grade will be used in place of the first grade to calculate your SMU GPA. 
Your first grade will always stay on your transcript, though, so please be aware that it could still impact you in the future if you choose to attend graduate school or transfer to another university."
"How many semesters of a language do I need?  I took a language in highschool; 
what if I don't want to study that same language?","SMU requires that each student is proficient in a world language at the intermediate level 
(equal to one year of language study at the university level). For many students, they need to complete 1-2 semesters of a language. 
If you received a 4 or 5 on an AP language exam or speak English as your second language, please talk with your academic advisor and review information on the Word Language & Literatures site. 
If you have experience in one language, but want to start a new language – that’s great! You may certainly take a new language. Talk with your academic advisor for assistance getting enrolled."
What Common Curriculum (CC) requirements do I have left?,"To determine what CC requirements you still need to complete, log-on to my.SMU, 
expand the Academics section and click on Degree Progress. Your Degree Progress Report (DPR) will appear on the screen. 
To view a list of requirements that haven't been satisfied yet, check the box next to Hide Satisfied Requirements."
How many hours does it take to complete the CC? Do I need to finish it during my first year?,"The number of hours it requires for each student to complete the CC varies based on major, course selections, 
and any credits they brought to SMU from high school or college. If you take a unique course for each requirement 
that’s outside your major/minor, students can expect to take 51-62 hours for their CC requirements. 
However, many classes overlap with major, minor, and/or multiple CC requirements, so you can strategically fulfill CC requirements with fewer classes. 
No, you do not need to complete the CC in your first year! In fact, for most students, that would be impossible. 
Focus on taking a few CC requirements each semester and talk with your academic advisor about how to maximize any requirements your major courses may cover."
How many hours do I need to be a full-time student?,"For fall and spring semesters, you need to take at least 12 hours. For summer sessions, you need at least 6 hours (or 12 hours for the full summer term). 
If you are receiving a scholarship, financial aid, are on a visa, are a student athlete, or plan to go through Greek recruitment, 
please check with one of the following offices to confirm the full-time status policy and how it may apply to you:
 Financial Aid, International Student & Scholar Services, Athletic Compliance Office, or Fraternity and Sorority Life."
How do I know how many hours I'm taking?,"There are a couple ways to do this. In your Student Dashboard, select Academics then Course List. 
Then simply add up the numbers in the Units column. Another way is to look at the course number. 
The second number from the left is how many credits the course is worth. For example, WRTR 1312 is worth 3 credit hours."
Where can I find class descriptions?,"When you search for a class on my.SMU, expand the course section you’re interested in taking. 
In the Information section you will find a description of the course along with any prerequisites."
I can't get into a class I want to take. What should I do?,"If the class is open, check the Enrollment Requirements for the course by expanding the course section and looking in the Information section. 
If you meet the criteria and still can’t enroll, email your advisor. If the class is waitlisted, you may add yourself to the waitlist or find another class to take in its place. 
Keep in mind that adding yourself to a waitlist will count towards your 18 maximum term hours. 
If the class is closed, you may keep watching the course to see if a spot opens up or you may find another class to take in its place."
What do I need to declare my major? What if I want to add a second major? What if I want to add a minor?,"Some majors have specific subset requirements you need to complete before you can apply/declare that major. 
To view the subset for majors outside of Cox, go to the SMU Catalog, click on your school, then, under your major, click on Go to information for this school/college. 
If you’ve already successfully completed your subset requirements, you need to fill out a Major Declaration Form with your academic advisor in the UAC. 
After you’ve declared a major with your UAC academic advisor, you may declare your second major and/or a minor with your
 School of Record (Dedman, Meadows, Cox, or Simmons). You cannot add a minor before declaring your major."

What are my major degree requirements?,"Your major requirements are listed in the SMU Catalog of your year of entry (if you started in Fall 2018 or Spring 2019, you are under the 2018-2019 Catalog).
