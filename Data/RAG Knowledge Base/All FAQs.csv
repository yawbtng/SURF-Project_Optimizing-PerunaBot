question, answer
What's the difference between all-college GPA and SMU GPA?,"Your all-college GPA is the GPA used from all your grades at any college or university you've attended, including SMU. 
Your SMU GPA is your GPA based only on your SMU grades. Some schools/majors use your all-college GPA or grades in courses you've
 taken at another institution to determine if they will admit you to their major."
What is a failing grade?,"An ""F"" is a failing grade. With a ""D-"" and above you will earn course credit, 
but may not meet the requirements for your major or be able to progress in a sequence of classes. 
If you make a ""C"" or lower in a class, double check your major requirements in the SMU Catalog or ask your academic advisor."
"Can I get ""Freshman Forgiveness""? What is a Grade Replacement Repeat?","""Freshman Forgiveness"" doesn't exist. However, SMU does have the Grade Replacement Repeat policy that students may take advantage of, 
regardless of their year. For classes taken Fall 2017 and later, if you made a D+ or lower in a course, 
you may repeat the course here at SMU and the second grade will be used in place of the first grade to calculate your SMU GPA. 
Your first grade will always stay on your transcript, though, so please be aware that it could still impact you in the future if you choose to attend graduate school or transfer to another university."
"How many semesters of a language do I need?  I took a language in highschool; 
what if I don't want to study that same language?","SMU requires that each student is proficient in a world language at the intermediate level 
(equal to one year of language study at the university level). For many students, they need to complete 1-2 semesters of a language. 
If you received a 4 or 5 on an AP language exam or speak English as your second language, please talk with your academic advisor and review information on the Word Language & Literatures site. 
If you have experience in one language, but want to start a new language that's great! You may certainly take a new language. Talk with your academic advisor for assistance getting enrolled."
What Common Curriculum (CC) requirements do I have left?,"To determine what CC requirements you still need to complete, log-on to my.SMU, 
expand the Academics section and click on Degree Progress. Your Degree Progress Report (DPR) will appear on the screen. 
To view a list of requirements that haven't been satisfied yet, check the box next to Hide Satisfied Requirements."
How many hours does it take to complete the CC? Do I need to finish it during my first year?,"The number of hours it requires for each student to complete the CC varies based on major, course selections, 
and any credits they brought to SMU from high school or college. If you take a unique course for each requirement 
that's outside your major/minor, students can expect to take 51-62 hours for their CC requirements. 
However, many classes overlap with major, minor, and/or multiple CC requirements, so you can strategically fulfill CC requirements with fewer classes. 
No, you do not need to complete the CC in your first year! In fact, for most students, that would be impossible. 
Focus on taking a few CC requirements each semester and talk with your academic advisor about how to maximize any requirements your major courses may cover."
How many hours do I need to be a full-time student?,"For fall and spring semesters, you need to take at least 12 hours. For summer sessions, you need at least 6 hours (or 12 hours for the full summer term). 
If you are receiving a scholarship, financial aid, are on a visa, are a student athlete, or plan to go through Greek recruitment, 
please check with one of the following offices to confirm the full-time status policy and how it may apply to you:
 Financial Aid, International Student & Scholar Services, Athletic Compliance Office, or Fraternity and Sorority Life."
How do I know how many hours I'm taking?,"There are a couple ways to do this. In your Student Dashboard, select Academics then Course List. 
Then simply add up the numbers in the Units column. Another way is to look at the course number. 
The second number from the left is how many credits the course is worth. For example, WRTR 1312 is worth 3 credit hours."
Where can I find class descriptions?,"When you search for a class on my.SMU, expand the course section you're interested in taking. 
In the Information section you will find a description of the course along with any prerequisites."
I can't get into a class I want to take. What should I do?,"If the class is open, check the Enrollment Requirements for the course by expanding the course section and looking in the Information section. 
If you meet the criteria and still can't enroll, email your advisor. If the class is waitlisted, you may add yourself to the waitlist or find another class to take in its place. 
Keep in mind that adding yourself to a waitlist will count towards your 18 maximum term hours. 
If the class is closed, you may keep watching the course to see if a spot opens up or you may find another class to take in its place."
What do I need to declare my major? What if I want to add a second major? What if I want to add a minor?,"Some majors have specific subset requirements you need to complete before you can apply/declare that major. 
To view the subset for majors outside of Cox, go to the SMU Catalog, click on your school, then, under your major, click on Go to information for this school/college. 
If youâ€™ve already successfully completed your subset requirements, you need to fill out a Major Declaration Form with your academic advisor in the UAC.

get a syllabus and work with your academic advisor on a petition to request approval to take the course."
How many hours do I need to graduate from SMU?,"Students under the University Curriculum need to complete at least 122 credit hours and 
students under the Common Curriculum need to complete at least 120 credit hours. This minimum hour requirement includes the requirements for your major and UC/CC."
What is PRW?,PRW stands for Personal Responsibility and Wellness. It is one of the UC requirements. Students under the CC requirements do not need to take a PRW course. 
What are the basic questions to ask the Financial Aid Office?,"What are the total costs I will need to cover as a student at SMU? How does this package of aid you have offered me cover those costs? 
How much will I need to borrow, and with what types of loans? What lenders do you recommend, and why? 
Do you have any financial relationship with the lenders you recommend?"
What applications do I need to complete to apply for financial aid?,"All students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year to determine their eligibility for federal and state financial aid (found at www.fafsa.ed.gov). 
Undergraduate students who also want to be considered for university need-based aid must complete the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® found at http://student.collegeboard.org/css-financial-aid-profile. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS/PROFILE®."
What is SMU's school code?,The FAFSA school code is 003613 The CSS/PROFILE® code is 6660.
Can you make too much money to qualify for financial aid?,"Although some students may not qualify for need-based aid in the form of grants, 
most students qualify to receive non-need based federal loans."
Do I have to re-apply for financial aid each year?,"Yes, all students must re-apply by renewing their FAFSA each year. 
Undergraduate students must also renew their CSS/PROFILE® application each year in order to be considered for university need-based aid."
When is the deadline to apply for financial aid?,"The priority deadline for first-year undergraduate students is February 15th each year. SMU has a priority deadline of April 15 for continuing undergraduate students so that financial aid advisors can award as much aid as possible after spring grades post in May. 
An undergraduate student who applies after the priority deadline may not receive primary consideration since certain financial aid funds can be limited. Graduate and professional students may file any time during the academic year; there is no priority deadline. However, SMU recommends filing the FAFSA no later than May 1st in order to secure funding before the start of the term."
"My parents don't claim me on their taxes, and I support myself. Can I claim myself as independent and only use my information on the FAFSA?","No. Most students who cannot answer ""Yes"" to at least one of the thirteen (13) dependency questions 
on the FAFSA must still include their parents' information."
My parents are divorced. Whose information do I use on the FAFSA?,"In most situations, you should use the custodial parent's information (and step-parent if s/he has remarried). 
This is the parent with whom you live the most and receive the most financial support."
What if I move off campus?,"After the second year a student is allowed to live off campus. SMU finds the expenses for living off campus less than living on campus. Please review the off campus budget listed on the costs page because your aid will be reduced accordingly. If a student needs more funds to cover their off campus housing expenses, please contact your financial aid advisor.
"
Do I have to live on campus?,"All 1st year students are required to live on campus or with parents. On rare occasions, students may apply for approval to live off campus with other relatives.
To inquire about this exception go to residential life. Please review the cost page for allowances for living off campus, 
your aid will be decreased to account for the decreased budget for housing."
Why would my financial aid package change if I change my housing arrangements?,"In order to determine how much a student may receive in financial aid, schools must first determine how much it will cost you to go to school.  The â€œTotal Cost of Attendance, often referred to as the COA, is the starting point for all financial aid awards.  It includes Tuition/Fees, Housing/Dining, an allowance for books/supplies, an allowance for transportation expenses, and an allowance for personal/miscellaneous expenses, all of which are combined to establish the total COA. Any change to one of the individual COA components will change the total COA
The COA serves as the maximum limit a student may receive in financial aid.  The combined total of all financial aid programs cannot exceed the COA. Therefore, a change in housing will change the COA which, as a result, changes the amount you may receive in financial aid.
Although, living on-campus housing provides many benefits, the costs for living on-campus are considerably higher than the cost of living at home.  Therefore, a change in housing from on-campus to living at home could result in a reduction in financial aid need based eligibility."
What financial aid awards may change?Â ,"Any need-based financial aid may change including federal, state and University need-based awards.  
For our institutional aid you may incur a reduction in the SMU Opportunity Award in your financial aid package."
What is the SMU Opportunity Award?Â ,"This is an SMU need-based grant that is awarded after all scholarships, federal and state grants have been added to your financial aid package and is based on your demonstrated need that is not met by any and all other scholarships or grants."
Will a change in housing impact my academic or talent-based scholarship be impacted?,"No, a change in your housing arrangements will not impact scholarships."
Will I have to pay more to the University?,"It depends on the change.  Every student's financial situation is unique.  If changing from on-campus to living at home, most student owe much less.  We recommend that you contact your financial aid advisor to see what the full impact will be for you.  Contact information for your financial aid advisor can be found here."
I have or will apply to live at home in the fall but return to on campus housing for the spring.Â  What happens to my aid?Â ,"When you return to on campus living your educational costs will reflect the cost of living on campus.  
Your spring aid would be reviewed and adjusted accordingly."
I have or will apply to live at home for the entire year.  What happens to my aid? ,"If you apply to live at home for the year, then you would petition through Residence Life.  If you receive an exemption from living on campus, your educational costs would be changed to reflect living at home and your financial aid adjusted accordingly."
I have or will apply to live at home through DASS for a COVID-19 related exemption.  What happens to my aid? ,"Depending upon where you will be living after your exemption is approved, your educational costs 
and aid will be adjusted to reflect your housing choice."
I have or will apply to live at home and will attend remotely for the academic year.  What happens to my aid? ,"If your petition to live at home is approved, your educational costs would be adjusted to reflect the 
living at home arrangement and your financial aid would be adjusted accordingly."
"I have been approved to live at home and will attend remotely for the academic year, can I change my mind?Â ","You should immediately contact Residence Life if you decide you would like to return to campus.  
If you are able to make this change, you should then contact your Financial Aid Advisor to make the changes to your educational costs and awards to reflect living on campus."
How do I apply for a Pell grant?,You are automatically considered for this federal need-based grant when you complete the FAFSA.
Are graduate students eligible for grants?,"Although graduate students are not eligible for federal grants like the Pell grant,
 they may be eligible to receive the state Tuition Equalization Grant (TEG)."
How do I apply for more scholarships?,"While university scholarships awarded during the admissions process are set, students are encouraged to apply for outside scholarships through websites like www.fastweb.com and www.collegeboard.com."
Are funds from Federal Work Study credited to my account?,"No, students must work a Federal Work Study job in order to receive a bi-weekly paycheck. 
Students are able to use these paychecks as they see fit."
Will SMU help me find a job?,The Hegi Family Career Center maintains a database of Federal Work Study and non federal work study campus jobs. We encourage the student to directly contact the hiring department. The Student Employment Office offers support to students and employers.
Does SMU provide a list of lenders from which to choose private educational loans?,"Like numerous institutions across the country, SMU provides students and families a list of lenders to 
assist them in navigating the complexities of borrowing a private educational loan, however a borrower can choose any lender not on SMU's lender list."
Can students and parents use other lenders?,"Yes, SMU allows students and their families to choose their own lender even if not on our list of lenders. 
SMU encourages all students to investigate a lender before choosing them."
What kind of research should I do regarding choosing a lender?,"You should compare repayment benefits and discounts with different lenders you are reviewing including finding out if the repayment benefits are still applicable if the lender sells your loan to another servicer or lender. 
Some other things you can ask are what percentages of borrowers actually end up qualifying for the repayment benefits; what timeframe their customer service is available; if interest rates are fixed or variable; 
if interest rates are reduced for on-time payments or auto debit; and when repayment starts and if interest accrues between disbursement and repayment."
How does SMU pick lenders for the lists?,"SMU sends an extensive survey to loan companies interested in processing private loans for students of the university. The survey is used to rate lenders for inclusion on one or more of the preferred lender lists. The university seeks lenders who offer the best customer service, secure electronic processes, repayment benefits, lowest origination points, and other benefits. You may contact the loan administrator at enrol_serv@smu.edu for further information on lender list selection. SMU does not receive any payments, benefits or perks from lenders for consideration of inclusion on the SMU lender lists."
Where do I view my bill?,"Student and miscellaneous accounts can be viewed online at SMUPay, which is found through the 
""Financial Account"" panel located on the My.SMU Student Homepage."
My bill doesn't look correct. What should I do?,You should contact Student Financial Services at 214-768-3417 or via email at enrol_serv@mail.smu.edu and speak with a Student Account Specialist regarding specific bill or account related questions.
How much does it cost to attend SMU?,Tuition and fee charges may be found on the Bursar website.
What happens to my financial aid if I drop a class?,"As long as undergraduate students remain enrolled in 12-18 hours, they are still considered full-time; therefore, their financial aid will not be affected. However, students who drop below 12 hours should check with their financial aid advisor regarding any possible changes to their financial aid package."
Must I be full-time to receive financial aid?,"If an undergraduate student is receiving federal and institutional need based aid, 12 hours is considered full time. However, SMU encourages all undergraduate students to enroll and complete 15 hours each semester so that they may graduate in 4 years (8 semesters). 
Sometimes completing 15 hours per semester may not be sufficient to graduate in 4 years, so students should consider attending summer school for 1-2 terms."
How many terms may I receive financial aid?,"Typically, institutional scholarships and need based aid are awarded for 8 semesters only to those who began SMU as first-year undergraduate students; students who enrolled as transfers usually receive institutional scholarships and need based aid for 5 semesters only."
How do I contact my financial aid advisor?,"Most financial aid related questions can be answered by our trained Enrollment Resources staff either over the phone or by coming to our service counter.
However,  we understand that there may be times when you need to speak with a designated financial aid advisor regarding circumstances that are unique to you.  Our advisors are available to assist students and families by phone, by appointment or if you just happen to be in the building and want to drop by.  
We're here to help.   All advisors may be reached via email at enrol_serv@smu.edu, by phone at 214-768-3417, or in person by appointment or walk-in. 
 Just check in through our service desk located on the first floor of the Blanton Student Services Building.  "
When do I register?Â ,"You may register during orientation, which you complete after you have applied and been admitted to SMU. 
Orientation is available for both incoming first year students and transfer students."
How do I know what classes to take?,"Upon entering SMU, you will begin fulfilling two general sets of requirements necessary to graduate: the Common Curriculum that all students must satisfy regardless of major, and the requirements specified by the major itself. 
First-year students are assigned to an academic advisor from Dedman College. Your advisor will work with you regarding selection of classes."
When can I see my academic advisor?,"You are assigned a professional advisor at orientation and are required to connect with him/her before registration each semester. You can also set up appointments on your own time throughout the semester. 
SMU provides students with a well-staffed, award-winning advising center of professional, full-time advisors."
"What exactly is a ""liberal arts"" curriculum?","The liberal arts disciplines include the humanities, the natural and the mathematical sciences, and the social sciences. With a foundation in the liberal arts, the SMU student gets a complete education - as a professional in a chosen career, a citizen in the world of ideas, 
and a full-fledged participant in life itself. SMU's general requirements in the liberal arts (the Common Curriculum) provide students with an exceptional educational opportunity."
How and when will I choose a major?Â ,"SMU offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and 85 minors. Your academic advisor and many other support systems are available to help you choose your major.

Will SMU send my grades to my parents?,"The Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act of 1974 states that no personally identifiable information from a student's record will be disclosed to a third party without prior written consent from the student. 
Grades may be released to parents if either the student completes a release form or the parent completes a Declaration of Dependency form. These releases are available in the Registrar's office. Once SMU has an approved release on file then the parent or student can request an official transcript."
Who can I talk to about my son/daughter's academic progress?,"It is our sincere hope that all of our students communicate with their families about their academic progress. 
If you have concerns or questions, you may contact your son or daughter's academic advisor. Please be aware that federal law prohibits us from discussing specific academic information unless we have obtained explicit permission from the student in the form of a signed release. 
Without this release, advisors are happy to discuss general university policies and procedures, as well as resources available to SMU students and families;
 however, we cannot discuss details related to a specific student."
What resources does SMU provide to help students academically?,"In addition to advising, SMU provides tutoring through the Altshuler Learning Enhancement Center (A-LEC). 
Students are also encouraged to visit the Hegi Family Career Center to explore different career paths, work on their resume, and develop interview skills."
How can I get more information on scholarships and financial aid?,"Academic advisors do not have access to students' financial information, so we recommend contacting 
Financial Aid for any questions about scholarships and other aid packages. For billing questions, please contact the Bursarâ€™s Office."
My son/daughter has a learning disorder/disability - who should we contact about accommodations?,"Disability Accommodations and Success Strategies (DASS) is located in the A-LEC. 
This office works closely with students to determine appropriate accommodations and develop techniques that foster achievement in a university setting."
My student came to SMU for a specific major but has not met the admissions requirements - what now?,"We know that this can be a difficult time for both students and their families. Everyone has invested time and resources into this path and it takes time to accept the loss of goals, plans, and hopes. 
The good news is that SMU offers a plethora of majors and minors that lead to diverse career opportunities. There is sure to be a course of study that is suitable to the studentâ€™s interests, strengths and abilities. 
What begins as a time of frustration can lead to tremendous growth and self-actualization."
I'm wondering about the schedule for registration/holidays/finals  - where can I find this information?,"Each year, the Office of the Registrar publishes the undergraduate academic calendar 
that contains all of the important dates for the academic year."
Does SMU award credit for classes taken at another college or university after starting at SMU?,"In most cases, yes, students may transfer credit from other accredited, four-year institutions to SMU. The semester before the student plans to study away from SMU, he or she should complete an Advance Approval of Transfer Credits form, 
which requires each course to be evaluated and approved by an academic department. Upon completion of the course, the student may be responsible for demonstrating specific Student Learning Outcomes to satisfy University Curriculum components or Common Curriculum Proficiencies & Experiences."
Who is required to live on campus?,"All first- and second-year students are required to live on campus in SMUâ€™s Residential Commons. The on-campus requirement is also met by second-year students who are eligible to reside in SMU Greek housing.
