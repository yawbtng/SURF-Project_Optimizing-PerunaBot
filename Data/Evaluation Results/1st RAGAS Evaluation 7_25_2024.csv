The University offers a range of \ndistinguished graduate and professional programs, and since its beginnings in 1915, SMU has remained committed \nto the concept of a rigorous and relevant liberal arts undergraduate education. All SMU undergraduate degree \nprograms reflect this commitment by encouraging students to combine broad, interdisciplinary inquiry with in- depth \nstudy in a particular field of inte rest. Preface to the Curriculum  \nAll SMU undergraduates participate in general education. General education provides students with a broad \nbackground in the liberal arts, which is essential to their growth as educated human beings. The general education \ncurriculum is designed to help students put their majors into context, to promote valuable skills that students acquire \nin and outside the classroom in preparation for the modern workplace, to enable and encourage students to engage in \ntheir civic responsibilities at the university and beyo nd, and to create a passion and platform for life -long learning. The elements of general education are foundation, breadth, and graduation requirements. These elements are \ndesigned to build on one another over the four -year undergraduate experience. Students begin in foundations with a \nfocus on writing, quantitative foundations, and second language proficiency. The breadth requirements, typically met in the first two years, provide students an opportunity to explore a variety of disciplinary frameworks for \nlearning. Finally, during their time at SMU, students gain a set of skills that are recognized through the graduation \nrequirements.""

 '63 \n Typically, a leave of absence is for one term or one academic year. A student may extend a leave of absence by \ncontacting Enrollment Services. The process to return to SMU after a leave- of-absence period can be an easy one, \nespecially if the student has go ne through the steps to file for a leave of absence and planned ahead for the return. Following SMU\'s leave -of-absence guidelines helps 1) assure that the degree requirements per the catalog of record \nwhen the student initially matriculated at SMU still ap ply upon return, 2) assist with financial aid processing, and 3) \nprovide the support needed to return to SMU and successfully finish the degree. The SMU Leave of Absence Policy provides students with a formal process to ""stop out"" of SMU for either \nvoluntary or involuntary reasons. Typically, a leave of absence is for a temporary departure from the institution; \nhowever, intended permanent withdrawals  from SMU will also be processed under the Leave of Absence \nPolicy. The maximum length of time for a leave of absence is 24 months. If a student doesn\'t return within that \nperiod, then the student must apply for reactivation. In addition, students who are participating in study- away programs that do not fall under the auspices of SMU \nshould complete the Leave of Absence Form. The completion of this process will assist all respective offices at SMU to create and monitor a formal , centralized record of the status for all students who are not enrolled. The Leave \nof Absence Form and Leave of Absence procedures are available at www.smu.edu/registrar (""Forms Library"" link). The University Policy Manual  is available at www.smu.edu/poli cy. The first step to effect a leave of absence is for the student to contact the Office of Student Success and Retention (ssr@smu.edu), who will then assist the student with the process.

multi_context,How does the Exploring Science course at SMU incorporate historical contexts in scientific inquiry within graduation requirements?,The answer to given question is not present in context,"The Exploring Science (ES) course at SMU is designed to develop students' ability to engage in scientific inquiry through a systematic, hypothesis-driven collection and analysis of evidence. While its primary focus is on scientific methods and literacy, it does not specifically incorporate historical contexts within its core objectives. Instead, the Historical Contexts (HC) requirement is a separate Breadth category that focuses on teaching students to analyze data from the past, recognize patterns of cause and effect, and understand the relationship between past and present.

To fulfill graduation requirements, students must complete both the ES and HC courses separately. The ES course emphasizes scientific literacy and inquiry, while the HC course develops historical thinking and analysis skills. Both are essential components of the Common Curriculum, but they address different aspects of a well-rounded education.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the SMU Undergraduate Catalog or the Common Curriculum website:

Creativity and Aesthetics  \nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of the conventions of a particular art form in a specified context through \nthe production and/or analysis of that form. To develop an understanding of and appreciation for the creative \nimpulse in various artistic contexts, graduates of SMU will demonstrate an understanding of the conventions of art \nforms and artistic analysis. They will be able to identify, explore and explain concepts fundamental to the visual, \ncommunicative, and performing arts through critical analysis, performance or the act of personal creation. CA \ncourses also seek to expose students to creativity's fundamental role in maintaining a robust, adaptive, and \nprosperous society. Students must take one three -semester -credit -hour course from the CA category. Exploring Science  \nAs a result of Exploring Science (ES), students will demonstrate an ability to engage in scientific inquiry.

 ""Students should be aware of the evidence -based, empirical methods of science, and of the ways that scientific fields \nhave shaped and informed the world around us. In completing the ES requirement, students must take and pass both \nlecture and lab courses (if offered separately). Historical Contexts  \nStudents will demonstrate an ability to engage in historical thinking upon fulfillment of Historical Contexts (HC). Historical thinking is an acquired (learned) form of analytical reasoning that allows students to analyze data from the \npast and recognize p atterns of cause and effect, and action and consequence. It requires factual knowledge of past \nevents and allows students to use that information to infer consequences and to understand the relationship between \npast action and present or future action. Mor eover, because historical thinking involves a recognition that there are \nmultiple ways of interpreting historical data, it allows for an appreciation of diverse viewpoints on any given topic. However, because it is a fact -based type of analysis, it also te aches students to evaluate arguments and critically \nassess sources of information. Students take one three -semester -credit -hour course from the HC category. Literary Analysis and Interpretation  \nLiterary Analysis and Interpretation (LAI) require students to analyze texts through close readings and demonstrate an understanding of the text's underlying historical, social, political, and cultural contexts in pursuit of an \nindividually -developed and w ell-argued analysis and interpretation. To expand their understanding of the world and \nthe modes of communication in it, students will demonstrate an ability to analyze texts through contextualized close \nreading. Students will analyze meaningful texts such as novels, poems, plays, and films. Students must take one \nthree -semester credit hour course from the LAI category. Philosophical, Religious, and Ethical Inquiry  \nPhilosophical, Religious, and Ethical Inquiry (PREI) expects students to demonstrate an understanding of philosophical, religious, or ethical concepts, traditions, or practices and their corresponding methods of inquiry. Philosophical and religious inquiry and ethics are related fields of analysis that invite students to explore and engage \ncritically with the concepts, problems, traditions, and practices constituting those fields of inquiry. These fields \nprovide students with the tools to understand and eva luate philosophical, religious, and ethical claims, to ask pointed \nquestions about the world, and to discover how to attend to the philosophical, religious, and/or ethical convictions or \nassumptions that inform diverse peoples and traditions. Beyond this, these fields all build students' analytical and \ncommunicative skills and cultivate an ability to engage in respectful dialogue. Students must take one, three -\nsemester -credit -hour course from the PREI category. One course may not satisfy both PREI and CIE. Social and Behavioral Sciences  \nThe sixth Breadth is Social and Behavior Sciences (SBS).

 'Common Curriculum   |  13\nBREADTH REQUIREMENTS \nBreadth courses introduce students to discipline-based ways \nof thinking. Students are required to complete seven Breadth \ncourses, each of which are at least three credit hours. Creativity and Aesthetics (CA)\nArt is a form of creative expression that has the capacity to move \nits creators and audiences emotionally and intellectually: it can \ndelight, entertain, empower, instruct, challenge or provoke. Art \ncan expand our understanding of ourselves and others across \nplace and time; foster collaboration and communal experience; \nand encourage nuanced thinking. The creation and analysis of  \nart can offer insight into this power, spur original thinking and \npromote a broader understanding of cultures past and present. Exploring Science (ES)\nScientific inquiry is a systematic process of exploring the natural  \nworld through a hypothesis-driven collection and analysis of  \nevidence. Many of the issues of the modern world rely on effec -\ntive understanding and critical interpretation of scientific subject \nmatter. Exploring Science courses are designed to produce  \nscientifically literate individuals who understand that scientific \nmethods can be leveraged for effective decision-making in a \nnumber of domains. All Exploring Science courses require a lab component. This \ncomponent may be embedded in the course, or you may sign up \nfor it separately. Historical Contexts (HC)\nHistorical thinking allows students to analyze data from the past; \nrecognize patterns of cause and effect; and understand the  \nrelationship between past and present. Moreover, because there \nare multiple ways of interpreting historical data and sources,  \nhistorical thinking builds an appreciation of diverse viewpoints  \non any given topic. It also teaches students to evaluate arguments \nand critically assess sources of information. Literary Analysis and Interpretation (LAI)\nLiterary analysis and its interpretation are essential skills in \nunderstanding the nuance of the texts all around us. These texts \nmay be literature, film, music, art and/or TV reports, news, shows, \nposters, social media threads and the like.'
