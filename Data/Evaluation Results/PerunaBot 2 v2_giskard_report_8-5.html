Texas residents who do not qualify for FAFSA may qualify for assistance through the State of Texas by filing the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA). All students are considered for SMU merit-based scholarships at the time of admission. In accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1965, SMU enforces the minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements for students receiving federal, state, and institutional based financial aid. These requirements are measured annually after the spring term grades have been posted.","The grounds for appeal are as follows: 1. Clearly erroneous findings of fact; 2.

However, once the intent is declared, it cannot be changed back to a letter grade. If a course is graded pass/fail for all students, the student&#x27;s declaration is not required. Students should consult with their academic advisers before declaring the pass/fail option, as some courses may not be taken as pass/fail. For courses taken on SMU Abroad programs, students must petition for the pass/fail option from the program director and the faculty member teaching the course.","The next review for the M.S. Counseling program at the Simmons School of Education is in 2026.","Undergraduate students who wish to change their academic program - transfer from one school to another within the University, change their degree objective, change their major or change their minor - should first notify the records office of the school in which they are currently enrolled.

However, changes should be made at least one week prior to enrollment for a term for the change to be effective for that enrollment.","Students who miss class due to religious holidays should be given an opportunity to make up class examinations or other graded assignments missed as a result of this participation or related travel. The manner in which these are to be made up is left to the discretion of each individual faculty member. Students should not be penalized for these excused absences and should be informed by the instructor at the beginning of the term, preferably in writing, of the instructor&#x27;s makeup policy. It is the responsibility of the student to make arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled examination or other missed assignment for making up this work.","The Proficiencies and Experiences graduation requirements develop key skills through coursework or experiences. These include 1. Civics and Individual Ethics (CIE), 2. Community Engagement (CE), 3. Global Perspectives (GPS), 4. Human Diversity (HD), 5. Oral Communication (OC), 6. Quantitative Applications (QA), and 7. Writing (W).

To make this request, the student must complete the applicable pre-approval petition, available through the Registrar&#x27;s Forms Library. Each course they wish to take must be individually petitioned, and these petitions must be reviewed and approved prior to enrollment. The review requires verification of F -1 or J -1 status and submission of a full and current syllabus for each course petitioned.","The Foundations requirements in the Common Curriculum assure that students read and write, think critically, and possess essential awareness of the multi-faceted nature of our complex world. These skills should be completed within a student&#x27;s first four terms of enrollment.","Through community engagement, students gain experience participating in multiple types of civic action.

This petition should be submitted to the appropriate records office within six months of the term in which the discrepancy appeared.","The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that grants students the right to inspect, obtain copies of, challenge, and, to a degree, control the release of information contained in their education records. SMU&#x27;s maintenance and disclosure of a student&#x27;s education records are governed by FERPA. Under this law, SMU cannot disclose personally identifiable information about a student to outside third parties, except under specific circumstances outlined in SMU&#x27;s Policy Manual. Exceptions include information defined by SMU as directory information, information authorized by the student, and information released to a parent or guardian if the student is declared financially dependent upon them.","Students can fulfill the Second Language requirement at SMU in several ways: 1. By presenting an appropriate score on a recognized second language proficiency exam (4 or 5 on AP exam; 5, 6, or 7 on IB HL exam). 2. By transferring a dual credit or post-high school transfer course equivalent to 3rd (2401) or a higher-level course at SMU. 3.

If still unsatisfied, the student may appeal the dean&#x27;s decision to the provost. However, the dean and the provost must respect the principle that the determination of a grade rests with the course instructor.","Effective for courses taken Fall 2017 or later, undergraduate students may repeat up to six courses taken at SMU for which grades of D+ or lower were received. The grade from the repeated course, even if lower, will be the grade used to calculate the student&#x27;s GPA. A course may be repeated only once under this policy. Students must repeat the exact same course originally taken to be considered a repeat. The course must be taken at SMU. Not every course is offered again and thus may not be available to be repeated. Students cannot take or repeat a course that is a prerequisite for a course already satisfactorily completed. The first six courses repeated will be coded as Grade Replacement repeats. A course being repeated that is dropped (W) will not count as a grade replacement repeat.","The subject strengths of the DeGoyler Library include the American West, Mexico, railroad history, business history, and the history of science and technology. The University Archives contain manuscripts, photographs, publications, records, and artifacts documenting the establishment and growth of the University.","The Caring Community Connections (CCC) program is a resource for anyone in the SMU community to refer students who may be experiencing academic, personal, emotional, financial, or other challenges. After a referral is made, students are contacted to discuss these concerns and strategize appropriate solutions.","Undergraduate students at SMU must follow the University-wide, general education and graduation requirements that are in effect for the academic year of their matriculation to SMU.

Students may not follow a catalog for an academic year in effect prior to their matriculation. Regarding privacy, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act governs SMU&#x27;s maintenance and disclosure of a student&#x27;s education records. FERPA provides students the right to inspect and review their education records and to seek amendment of those records.","Graduation candidates must clear all Incompletes prior to the deadline on the Official University Calendar, which may allow less time than 12 months. Failure to do so can result in removal from the degree candidacy list and/or conversion of the grade of I to the grade indicated by the instructor at the time the grade of I was given. Courses taken on SMU Abroad fall and spring term programs may not be taken on a no-credit or pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is for courses designated by SMU&#x27;s academic departments with no credit or pass/fail as their only grading basis option.","Dual credit is work completed through a college (which could be taken at the college or at the high school) that counts for both college credit and high school graduation requirements. Concurrent credit, on the other hand, is work completed through a college that the high school does not give credit for graduation purposes.","Eligible students for Visiting Student Studies at SMU are those participating in special SMU initiatives such as concurrent or summer enrollment opportunities for college and high school students, and members of the Dallas community who wish to take SMU Courses for personal enrichment.
