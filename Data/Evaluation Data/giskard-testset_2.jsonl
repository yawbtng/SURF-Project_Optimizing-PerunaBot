The act and regulations are very lengthy, and for that reason, SMU has issued its own FERPA -based \nguidelines that are available at the University Registrar's Office FERPA website www.smu.edu\/FERPA. Policy 1.10 of the University Policy Manual also discusses this law.  \nIn general, no personally identifiable information from a student's education record will be disclosed to any third\n\nDocument 152: party without written consent from the student. Several exceptions exist, including these selected examples: 1) information defined by SMU a s directory information may be released unless the student requests through my.SMU \nStudent Dashboard that it be withheld, 2) information authorized by the student through my.SMU Student Dashboard may be released to those individuals designated by the stude nt and 3) information may be released to a \nparent or guardian if the student is declared financially dependent upon the parent or guardian as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.
