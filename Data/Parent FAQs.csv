Who can I talk to about my son/daughter's academic progress?,"It is our sincere hope that all of our students communicate with their families about their academic progress. 
If you have concerns or questions, you may contact your son or daughter's academic advisor. Please be aware that federal law prohibits us from discussing specific academic information unless we have obtained explicit permission from the student in the form of a signed release. 
Without this release, advisors are happy to discuss general university policies and procedures, as well as resources available to SMU students and families;
 however, we cannot discuss details related to a specific student."
What resources does SMU provide to help students academically?,"In addition to advising, SMU provides tutoring through the Altshuler Learning Enhancement Center (A-LEC). 
Students are also encouraged to visit the Hegi Family Career Center to explore different career paths, work on their resume, and develop interview skills."
How can I get more information on scholarships and financial aid?,"Academic advisors do not have access to students' financial information, so we recommend contacting 
Financial Aid for any questions about scholarships and other aid packages. For billing questions, please contact the Bursar’s Office."
My son/daughter has a learning disorder/disability - who should we contact about accommodations?,"Disability Accommodations and Success Strategies (DASS) is located in the A-LEC. 
This office works closely with students to determine appropriate accommodations and develop techniques that foster achievement in a university setting."
My student came to SMU for a specific major but has not met the admissions requirements - what now?,"We know that this can be a difficult time for both students and their families. Everyone has invested time and resources into this path and it takes time to accept the loss of goals, plans, and hopes. 
The good news is that SMU offers a plethora of majors and minors that lead to diverse career opportunities. There is sure to be a course of study that is suitable to the student’s interests, strengths and abilities. 
What begins as a time of frustration can lead to tremendous growth and self-actualization."
I'm wondering about the schedule for registration/holidays/finals  - where can I find this information?,"Each year, the Office of the Registrar publishes the undergraduate academic calendar 
that contains all of the important dates for the academic year."
Does SMU award credit for classes taken at another college or university after starting at SMU?,"In most cases, yes, students may transfer credit from other accredited, four-year institutions to SMU. The semester before the student plans to study away from SMU, he or she should complete an Advance Approval of Transfer Credits form, 
which requires each course to be evaluated and approved by an academic department. Upon completion of the course, the student may be responsible for demonstrating specific Student Learning Outcomes to satisfy University Curriculum components or Common Curriculum Proficiencies & Experiences."
