# Integrating Chatbot Arena into My Research: Evaluating RAG Pipelines with Human Feedback

## Introduction

In my research project, I have developed four Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. These pipelines are designed to answer questions based on the data you provide. To evaluate how well they perform, I am using the concept of a Chatbot Arena, which relies on human feedback for assessment.

## What is Chatbot Arena?

Chatbot Arena is a platform for evaluating language models through human interaction. It lets users test multiple models in real-time and give feedback on their performance.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can talk to multiple RAG pipelines at the same time.
- **Human Feedback**: Users' feedback is used to measure how well each model performs.

## Tailoring Chatbot Arena to My Research

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User Engagement**
   - Users chat with the four RAG pipelines I developed.
2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Users provide feedback on the responses, including ratings, comments, and comparisons.
3. **Data Analysis**
   - The feedback is analyzed to identify strengths and weaknesses of each RAG pipeline.
4. **Pipeline Improvement**
   - Insights from the feedback are used to refine and improve the pipelines.

### Implementing the Chatbot Arena

- **Setup**: Deploy the four RAG pipelines on the Chatbot Arena platform.
- **User Interaction**: Invite users to engage with the pipelines.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to rate responses, leave comments, and compare pipelines.
- **Analysis Tools**: Use tools to process feedback and identify key performance indicators.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve the pipelines based on feedback.

### Hosting and Accessibility

- **Platform**: The Chatbot Arena will be created using Streamlit.
- **Hosting**: It will be hosted on Streamlit Cloud, making it easy for people to test and give feedback.

## Data Analysis and ELO Ranking

### How ELO Ranking Works

- **Initial Rating**: Each pipeline starts with an initial rating.
- **Matchups**: Users compare responses from different pipelines, creating matchups.
- **Feedback as Results**: Feedback is treated as results. A preferred response is a "win."
- **Rating Updates**: Ratings are updated based on feedback. Winning pipelines gain points, losing pipelines lose points.
- **Continuous Adjustment**: Ratings adjust with ongoing feedback, providing an up-to-date ranking.

## Benefits of Using Chatbot Arena in My Research

- **Enhanced Evaluation**: Human feedback provides a detailed evaluation of the pipelines.
- **User-Centric Development**: Feedback ensures the pipelines meet user needs.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The competitive environment encourages ongoing improvements.

## Conclusion

Using Chatbot Arena in my research allows for a detailed, user-focused evaluation of the RAG pipelines I developed. Human feedback ensures the models are effective and aligned with user expectations. The insights gained, combined with the ELO ranking system, will drive innovation and improve performance. Hosting the Chatbot Arena on Streamlit Cloud makes it accessible for broad user participation and feedback.
