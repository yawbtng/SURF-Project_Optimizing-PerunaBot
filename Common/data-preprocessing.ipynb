The 30 hours must include PHIL 1301, PHIL 3351, PHIL 3352; \\nat least one course from the seque nce PHIL 3311 –PHIL 3329; and at least one course from the sequence PHIL 3370 \\n- PHIL 3389 or PHIL 3363. SMU Degree Requirements  \\nAn SMU undergraduate degree requires a minimum of 120 credit hours and must include completion of the \\nUniversity's Common Curriculum, one major and a combination of electives and/or other majors or minors. Completion of certain majors requires more than 120 hours to finish the degree. The credit hours within this \\ncurriculum are distributed as follows: \\nRequirements for the Major  \\nCore Courses (15 Credit Hours)  \\n• PHIL 1301 - Elementary Logic \\n• PHIL 3351 - History of Western Philosophy (Ancient)  \\n• PHIL 3352 - History of Western Philosophy (Modern)  \\nMetaphysics and Epistemology (3 Credit Hours)  \\nOne course from the following:  \\n• PHIL 3312 - Introduction to Philosophy of Language  \\n• PHIL 3313 - Knowledge and Skepticism  \\n• PHIL 3314 - Metaphysics  \", metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/yawbt/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/SURF-Project_Optimizing-PerunaBot/Data/20232024 Undergraduate Catalog91123.pdf', 'page': 290}),\n",
