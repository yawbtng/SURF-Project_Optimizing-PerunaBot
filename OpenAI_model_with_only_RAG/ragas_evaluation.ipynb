Consideration is also given to creative or scholarly potential for the program to be undertaken and to particular talent in performing areas. Admissions criteria pertinent \\nto each instructional uni t also must be satisfied. Readmission  \\nStudents should contact the Division of Enrollment Services, Office of Undergraduate Admission regarding \\nreadmission.

Undergraduate Student Financial Aid  \\nFor many SMU students, scholarships and other aid make the cost of attending a distinguished university no more, \\nand often less, taxing on their families' financial resources than attending a public university. More than 75 percent \\nof SMU students receive some type of financial aid. More information is available in the Student Financial Aid \\nsection of this catalog or through the Division of Enrollment Services, Office of Financial Aid: \\nwww.smu.edu/financial_aid, phone 214- 768-3417. SMU has a generous program of merit scholarships, grants, loans and part -time jobs to recognize academic \\nachievement and talent in specific fields and to meet financial need. Meadows Undergraduate Artistic Scholarships  \\nThe divisions and centers comprising Meadows School of the Arts annually award scholarships for outstanding achievement in a particular discipline.
