Named in honor of Dallas entrepreneur and industry leader Bobby B. Lyle in 2008, the school was established in response to a petition from the Technical Club of Dallas, a professional organization of practicing engineers. This group sought to fulfill the need for an engineering school in the Southwest and played a significant role in the school's founding.\n",

      "- **Civil Engineering**\n",
      "- **Computer Science**\n",
      "- **Electrical and Computer Engineering**\n",
      "- **Environmental Engineering**\n",
      "- **Mechanical Engineering**\n",
      "- **Management Science**\n",

      "\n",
      "### Cooperative Education Program\n",
      "One of the unique features of the Lyle School of Engineering is its Cooperative Education Program, one of the first in the United States. This program allows students to alternate between terms of full-time work and full-time school, providing them with real-world technical experience.\n",
